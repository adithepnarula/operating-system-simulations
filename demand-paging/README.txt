1. There are 5 "primary" classes: Driver, VirtualPage, RandomFile, Process, and PageFrame
2. There are 3 "algorithms" classes: LIFO, LRU, and Random
3. The driver is the starting point of the program
4. Go to driver and input your command line argument.
5. The command line accepts a string of 7 arguments in the following format:
"10 10 20 1 10 lru 0", where: first argument is machine size, second is page size, third is process size
fourth is job mix, fifth is number of references per process, and sixth is replacement algorithm, and the last is just a dummy which is ignored
6. Press play, since back, relax and enjoy.
