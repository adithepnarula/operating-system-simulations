1. My program has 7 classes: Driver, FCFS_V3_test, Processes, RandomFile, RR_V2, SFJ, and Uniprogram.
2. Run the program from Driver class.
3. My program accepts either 1 or 2 arguments from command line.
4. If one argument is given, it will run in normal mode.
5. If two arguments are given, it will run in verbose mode. 
6. My program will run all algorithms on a given input file in the following order: FCFS, RR, Uniprocessing, and SJF.
7. The random file is included in the program. The filepath is hardcoded in RandomFile class.
8. Press play, sit back relax and enjoy the statistics.
