READ ME:
1. My program was written in Java using Eclipse IDE
2. There are four classes: Symbol, LinkerV2, Module and SymbolTableObj
3. LinkerV2 contains the main logic, please run the program from there. 
4. Compile LinkerV2 on the server along with other classes
5. LinkerV2 takes COMMAND LINE INPUT only. 
6. The input only requires the name of the file that has all the modules.
7. An example on my eclipse IDE: I would go to run configurations, arguments tab,
and use this as my command line input >> C:\\Users\\inputfile9.txt 
7. Sit back, relax, and enjoy.
